                    your own. Also, the built-in photo-editing features help you enhance your banners further.

                   <br>
                   Not only can you edit stunning photos but apply 
                   them to creating outstanding banner ads. With Photoshop, 
                   you can even create 3D graphics.

                   Using Photoshop can be funny with drawing pads. 
                   Adobe Photoshop is known for its great drawing pad 
                   support for more realistic design processes.

                   <br>
                   The major drawback to Photoshop is that it takes a while to learn. 
                   There are so many bells and whistles that it’s not possible to 
                   master the tool in a day or two.

                 Adobe Illustrator is a well-rounded graphic 
                 design tool for professional creators.
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   You can do any type of graphic design 
                   or image-making activities with Illustrator.
                   <br>
                   <br>
                  If you are designing banner ads or ads in general, 
                  you can find Adobe Illustrator to be of great use.
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   Adobe Illustrator comes with amazing typography features. 
                   There are loads of fonts to choose from to make your banners
                    stand out.
                    <br>
                   <br>
                   Illustrator allows for the creation of vector graphics. 
                   This means graphics that can be scaled without loss of detail. 
                   This makes it easy to design for different screen sizes and contexts.
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   Also, you can experiment with a variety of colors and shapes, and save
                   the graphic in a format ideal for you.
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   The major drawback to Adobe Illustrator is the steep learning curve. 
                   It takes a long time before you master the tool. If you are a more 
                   serious creator working with graphics in the future, Adobe Illustrator
                    is a must-have skill set.
                    <br>
                   <br>
                   But if you are a beginner looking to create banners less frequently, 
                   perhaps try some of the banner-focused tools later on in this list.

                 Canva is a popular and modern graphic design software. 
                 You can easily create click-worthy banner ads without having 
                 experience in graphic design or ad creation.

                   <br>
                   But what makes Canva stand out?
                   <br>
                   <br>
                  Canva has a huge library of pre-built templates and assets that are ready to use! 
                  You don’t need to have any experience in design to create something beautiful.
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   In Canva, there is a template for pretty much anything you can imagine. 
                   This includes ads and more specifically banner ads. With a couple of clicks, 
                   you have a professional-looking banner at your disposal.
                    <br>
                   <br>
                   There is a free version of Canva. Besides, there are some paid plans for more 
                   extensive use. One cool feature of Canva is you can pay for a particular 
                   template as well. So if you fall in love with one particular template, 
                   you don’t have to spend money for a paid plan.
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   As the icing on the cake, Canva makes it possible to animate any design. 
                   Furthermore, you can export the animation as a GIF for free!
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   Canva is easy to learn and thus a beginner-friendly banner-making software. 
                   And remember, you can use Canva for much more than banners. 
                   Banners are just a small subset of all of the versatile features.

                    Abyssale is an easy-to-use banner creator. You can use this tool with little

                     </mj-text>
                     <mj-text mj-class="img-text-body">
                    The tool is unique because it uses the latest advancements in AI to 
                    generate images and banners.

                     <mj-text mj-class="img-text-body">
                    Of course, even though it’s possible to auto-generate ads, you can fully customize them too.

                 As a drawback to this tool, it has no good design capabilities. 
                 The main function of this tool is to use AI to generate banners. 
                 If you need more customizability or want to be more creative, 
                 use a professional tool like Illustrator or Photoshop.

                Add, replace, or remove elements until you’re good with the result. 
                By the way, you can add cool charts and visual effects to further enhance your banners.

                 With a free version, you can only download JPG files with watermarks!

                   <mj-text mj-class="img-text-body">
                Although there is a free version and download, you should also 
                consider the paid plans. For example, one of the great benefits 
                of the paid plan is the 2M+ free-to-use images and thousands 
                of premium templates. Besides, there are other great graphical 
                resources to choose from.

                     <mj-text mj-class="img-text-body">
                The drawback to Visme is that the free version is very limited. 
                It doesn’t give you a great picture of the tool. Furthermore, 
                the paid plans are expensive as opposed to other similar tools. 
                Also, the graphic library is smaller than other similar tools.

                 Bannerbear is a banner-focused tool to create outstanding banners. 
                 Its specialty is the image creation API which helps you auto-generate banners that:

                  There are loads of built-in assets and graphics for 
                  your marketing campaigns as well. So you won’t 
                  have to start empty-handed.

                   <br>
                   Usability is the main concern here. I mean, the tool is powerful, 
                   but it takes a while to learn how to use it. 
                   If you have no technical background, an API makes 
                   absolutely no sense to you. Due to the technical complexity, 
                   most users cannot make the most of the tool.
                   <br>
                   <br>
                    On the other hand, if you are someone with coding knowledge, 
                    integrating the API can offer superpowers to your graphic design tools.
